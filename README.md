# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is the science of planning designing,testing,depeloyment and maintanance of softwares
1. increase efficiency
2. increase productivity
3. fast service delivery

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.mastering machine this was hardware dependent
2.mastering process- models inapplicability was a problem
3.mastering complexity-



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.waterfall- its linears and sequential phase has to be done beforemoving to next
2.agile -it the phase whereby a project in broken down and done partly
3.iterative -its a repeated cycle of development
4.incremental - a project is divided into portion each delivered separately
5.spiral - this incoparates both iterative and incremental models of work
6.verification and validation(v model) -this emphasizes the relationship between development and testing stages
7.RAD model (rapid application development) -  It involves user feedback and iterations to rapidly refine and enhance the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall model a project is done one bit at and delivered as whole project as for agile model a large project is broken down into small project

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer- he creates design programes of all sort
quality asurance engineer -is concerned on principles and practice of product and serves quality control
project manager -assign task overseeing the team and evaluate their perfomance

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IED - is asoftware that help programmer to code effeciently increasing productivity
VCS -is the practice to manage and tracking software codes
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.growing customer demands
2.security
3.time constraints
4.limited infrastructure

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT -this are very low level and close to th source of application
INTEGRATION - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
SYSTEM -focus on the business requirements of an application
ACCEPTANCE - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
PROMPT ENGINEERING-is the practice of designing inputs for AI tools that will produce optimal outputs
1.enhance our ability and influence on how we communicate

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
